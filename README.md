# Hollywoods-Most-Profitable-Stories-R-Michaelwech

The Hollywood movie data analysis project is a project that was meant to show the relationship between using the R programming lamguage for cleaning data and also how such cleaned data can be well visually represented using Power-Bi as a viisualisation tool for data analysis througgh graphs and charts alike to make meaningful insights to drive decisions.

Here we have a raw file listing the top hollywoods most profitable stories, this file which is in it's raw state needed to be cleaned properly to remove all inconsistencies and irregularities so the data which would be produced would be consistent and true in line with data quality standards and make it suitable to derive quality analysis from.

During the cleaning process we removed all outliers in our data set because these outliers are capable of affecting the results and analysis in a negative way, depending on what insights we are trying to gather from this raw data, while using the profitability column as a reference in the R studio, i was able to remove the outliers in the Q1 and Q3 percentile of our data to generate a newly cleaned data which would be able to be analysed to produce correct visuals.

VISUAL REPRESENTATION USING POWER-BI
Using the power-Bi tool can be really powerful to show and represent various kinds of data visually for clearer insights and to properly pass information clearly,
So to properly and efficiently represent our clean file visually i imported it into the Power-bi software and proceeded to visual manipulation and representation
Note that our aim with the data set was to show the following

* The number of movies produced per year
* The audience score for each movie
* The profitability per studio
* The worldwide gross per genre

Findings

After analysing the data various insights were derived from this analysis which could inform companies on what steps to make from a business perspective

Finding 1;
After Analysis it was discovered that during this period of time comedy movies were actually the hihgest grossing movies so basically from a business and economic point of view it would be a wise decision for studios to invest in very good comedy scripts as the trend shows that they can actually gross higher than their contemporaries

Finding 2;
We found that 2010 had the most number of movies produced compared to other years with the closest being 2008 which included all genres. Tying this to our first finding its interesting to know that out of the movies produced in 2010, comedy movies accounted for more than 60% of the total movies produced in 2010, this goes to explain the success the comedy genre had in 2010 overall.

Finding 3;
we also found after analysis that during this period fantasy movies had an overall highest rotten tomatoes ratings, which goes to explaing that the set of fantasy movies produced during this period were well made to attract such high ratings from rotten tomatoes.

Finding 4;
Analysis shows that in this period Independent studios made the most profit which means business wise they made more commercially attractive movies.

Finding 5;
A dangerous method scored the highest during a fan survey to score the best movie of this period to place it above the rest of the other movies during the period

These visuals are well represented in the POWER-bi dashboard (file) attached in this repository.
