# Hollywoods-Most-Profitable-Stories-R-Michaelwech

The Hollywood movie data analysis project is a project that was meant to show the relationship between using the R programming lamguage for cleaning data and also how such cleaned data can be well visually represented using Power-Bi as a viisualisation tool for data analysis througgh graphs and charts alike to make meaningful insights to drive decisions.

Here we have a raw file listing the top hollywoods most profitable stories, this file which is in it's raw state needed to be cleaned properly to remove all inconsistencies and irregularities so the data which would be produced would be consistent and true in line with data quality standards and make it suitable to derive quality analysis from.

During the cleaning process we removed all outliers in our data set because these outliers are capable of affecting the results and analysis in a negative way, depending on what insights we are trying to gather from this raw data, while using the profitability column as a reference in the R studio, i was able to remove the outliers in the Q1 and Q3 percentile of our data to generate a newly cleaned data which would be able to be analysed to produce correct visuals.

VISUAL REPRESENTATION USING POWER-BI
Using the power-Bi tool can be really powerful to show and represent various kinds of data visually for clearer insights and to properly pass information clearly,
So to properly and efficiently represent our clean file visually i imported it into the Power-bi software and proceeded to visual manipulation and representation
Note that our aim with the data set was to show the following

* The number of movies produced per year
* The audience score for each movie
* The profitability per studio
* The worldwide gross per genre

These visuals are well represented in the POWER-bi dashboard (file) attached in this repository.
